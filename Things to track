  Specify clode blocks in each (<code> or <pre>)


1: Shares a parent with the button that creates the dropdown. May need to create a special case?
2: Both the title and the id secions share the class "table-list-cell" which is the only identifier for the commit title section.
    The id section does have the class "commit-links-cell"
3: No unique selector, may have unique children though
4: No unique selector, may be able to get by with <ul>? Can just do individual issues
